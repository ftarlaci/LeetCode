# LeetCode

This repository contains some of the coding questions I have solved and submitted on LeetCode.com to provide a peek into (or dissect if you like) some of my stylistic/algorithmic programming choices and to demonstrate my algorithmic thinking and approaches to various problems. 

Files are named after the questions as listed on LeetCode. Each file includes the verbatim statement of the question from the website, commented out on top of the file.
